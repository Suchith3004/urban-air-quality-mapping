# Identifying Priority Areas for Poor Air Quality Mitigation

Given the ill effects of air quality and the disparity faced by more vulnerable communities, it is inefficient for olicy makers to address the whole city at once. If anything, renovations may simply improve affluent communities once again. So rather policy makers and urban planners need a guide to identify the areas to address and which are in most need of help. Utilizing the existing correlationsbetween air quality and its indicators, socioeconomic status, demographic, green space, and traffic density, I plan to spatially analyze vulnerability, with respect to air pollution, and determine the areas within Detroit, MI that require immediate improvement.
